# Changelog

All notable changes to this project are recorded here.

Format follows [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.1.0/). Versioning follows [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html).

## [Unreleased]

### Changed

- A session's topic now wears its state as a leading glyph in the name — `▸` running, `⏸` awaiting approval, `✓` done, `✗` failed, `⊘` cancelled — renamed on every transition through the one path that also writes the row, so the name cannot disagree with the database. `icon_color` is set once at creation, because `editForumTopic` cannot change it afterwards.

## [0.2.1] — 2026-08-08

Both fixes came out of live testing in a real group, not review.

### Fixed

- Single-use cards now clear their buttons. The approval path did this; `confirmTrust` and group pairing did not, so a pairing card kept working-looking buttons after it had been answered. The clear moved to the callback fork, after the principal check, so a member outside the sender allowlist still cannot wipe the operator's card.

### Added

- A readiness report after group pairing, repeated by `/status` in any non-private chat. Privacy mode stays on by design, so Telegram delivers only commands addressed to the bot, replies to its own messages, and service messages — an ordinary group message never arrives. That was documented but never said to the operator, so a working bot read as a broken one. The report also states whether topics are available, and that granting the rights they need makes the bot an admin, which makes it receive every message in the group.

## [0.2.0] — 2026-08-07

Groups, a trust window, service units, and a second interface language.

### Added

- Allowlisted groups: a chat allowlist and a sender allowlist that must both match, with pairing confirmed by a signed button in the operator's DM and the disclosure stated on the card.
- `/commands`, `/usage`, `/yolo <duration>`, and `/lock`, bringing the registered set to eight.
- A Caraka trust window opened by `/yolo`: one workspace, a mandatory duration capped at sixty minutes, closed by `/lock`, expiry, or restart. Permission requests are still received, the high-risk list still stops for a button, and every automatic decision is audited.
- `caraka service --print` writes a systemd, launchd, or schtasks unit to stdout. It installs nothing, has no `postinstall` hook, and never prints `sudo`.
- English and Indonesian interfaces, chosen once at `init` and never inferred from a message.
- `caraka stop`, a PID file, a twenty-message-per-minute rate limit, and a thirty-minute run limit.

### Limited

- `bypassPermissions` remains reachable only from the terminal, through `caraka trust --bypass`. No chat path reaches it.
- The launchd and schtasks units are printed but untested on their platforms.

## [0.1.0] — 2026-08-07

First usable preview for one private Telegram operator and Claude Code.

### Added

- `init`, `doctor`, and `start` commands with one-time Telegram pairing.
- Claude ACP initialize, new/load session, prompt streaming, permission requests, and cancellation.
- Optional private-chat topics with automatic linear-mode fallback.
- Signed, principal-bound, session-bound, single-use approval callbacks with a ten-minute TTL.
- Mode-`0600` token storage, outbound secret scrubbing, and append-only SQLite audit.
- Rich Telegram results with plain-text fallback and code-fence-aware splitting.
- English and Indonesian install docs plus a safe prompt for Codex or Claude to assist installation.
- Unit, mock Telegram e2e, package, and authenticated Claude ACP smoke checks.

### Limited

- One operator, bot, workspace, and Claude Code adapter.
- Foreground process only. Groups, services, memory, attachments, and other coding agents remain roadmap work.
